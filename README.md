7. Each research question's visualization is saved as an html file in the internet-access-us directory, with a corresponding name (i.e. q1_chart.html). 
	* To view these visualizations, drag the html file out to a browser and view them in the browser.
	* Several of our visualizations are interactive--specifically, those for research questions 1, 3, and 5.
		Hover your mouse over various areas in these visualizations to display the exact data value at that corresponding location.
